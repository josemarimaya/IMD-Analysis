# IMD-Analysis
IMDB's worst rating films

We have chosen the Kaggle dataset for the study since it seems to me to be an interesting field of study to see why certain visual products fail.

As an objective for the project, I have decided to use the dataset to extract what combination of properties is most general for movies to fail.

To do this we have used the analysis techniques seen in class, in our case using community analysis to be able to draw general conclusions depending on whether a majority meets this property.
